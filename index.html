<h2>Food <span class="food-guide">photography</span></h2>
<p>Food and travel is a particularly compelling type of food blogging because it involves the engagement of different cultures. These bloggers travel around the globe, visiting and eating their way through cities known for food like Bangkok, Chengdu, and Tokyo,as well as lesser known hot food spots like Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, and Karachi,documenting their experience as they go. Food and travel blogging involves a lot of research, shooting, editing, investing & scheduling involved.These blog hosts bear the challenge of embracing other cultures and experiences, even if that means stepping out of their comfort zone.</p>
